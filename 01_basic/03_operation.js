// here we see how operation work and why use the string
let value = 5
let negvalue = -value
console.log ( negvalue)   // so here how can we change a positive value to a negative value

// so there is a basic mathemathical operation also in the operation
console.log(2+2)
console.log(2-2)
console.log(2*2)
console.log(2**3) // so basically it is used to give the power to the any number if i write the 3**3 it show that the power of the 3 of 3 is what comes 
console.log( 3 % 2)

// one more operation where we can add the string also
let str1 = "Hari is "
let str2 = "learning js"
console.log ( str1 + str2)  // so this is how we can fix operation in the string

// here is amore covertion of string and the simple number
console.log( 1 +  "2") 
console.log( "1" +  2)
console.log( "1" + 2 + 2 ) // here it act as normal string and the number
console.log( 1 +  2 + "2") // here it as number first and then  add the string in it 
console.log(true)
console.log(+true)
console.log( +" ") // this all are precidence operator

/* in this convesion we see that it perform like a board mass in where the location of the sign decude where to start the value from
so bassically here it act the if the string is in the first the all value will be the string
 and if the first number is normal value then it act as the normal value
