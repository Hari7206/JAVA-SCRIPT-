// so in this we are goona learn about how to compare data types by the help of operator
// console.log(  3 == 4 )
// console.log(  3 == 43 )
// console.log(  3 < 4 )
// console.log(  3 > 4 )
//  console.log("hellow world")  // but we are not goona talk about this basic comparsion
console.log("3" == 4)
console.log("3" < 4)
console.log("3" > 4)  //so here  we can see that it autmatically change  the striing into number so this type of comparision is wronge so we have to only do the comparsion of same data type 

console.log("")
// so here we have a some different comparision also 
console.log(null > 0)
console.log(null < 0)
console.log(null >= 0) // so here the comparsion operator change it to the number so that why the null >= is output as the true it convert it to the nmumber . 
/* 
so here our equality check and the camprasion check operator work differrently 
== is a equality check
=< is an comaparsion check
*/

// here one momre operator 
console.log("2" === 2) // in normal check of == is only check the equality it does not check the data type it convert data to ssme data types , where as the === check the data types strictly it check the data types and does not allow the conversionconsole.log("2" === 2)
console.log("2" == 2)   // upper one showes the output is false where as it shows the  ture
